# pi-monte-carlo
A simple Golang implementation of the Monte Carlo method for simulating pi.

I wrote this early on in my experience with Go just to have an excuse to use channels.

This is such a well-known problem that I won't bore you with my own explanation of it.  See method number 1 here:  https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/estimating-%CF%80-using-monte-carlo-simulations-3459a84b5ef9  They explain it just fine.  :)
